The codes in this repository reproduce the experimental results from _Selection from Hierarchical Data with Conformal e-values_ .

The functions.R file contains the helper functions necessary to run the procedures and simulations.

selection_subsampling.R, selection_hierarchical.R, and selection_group.R reproduce the experiments in Section 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, respectively.

income.R and blood_pressure.R reproduce the experiments in Section 6.1 and 6.2, respectively.

ite.R reproduce the simulations in Section B.1.
